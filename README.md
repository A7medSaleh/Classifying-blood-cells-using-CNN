Medical image analysis is the science of analyzing or solving medical problems using different image analysis techniques for effective and efficient extraction of information. It has emerged as one of the top research area in the field of engineering and medicine. Recent years have witnessed rapid use of machine learning algorithms in medical image analysis.

This code trains and tests a CNN to be used in the classification of different types of white blood cells. With the code there a data set for four different types of white blood cells, EOSINOPHIL, LYMPHOCYTE, MONOCYTE, and NEUTROPHIL. The first code Create_CNN trains the cnn to the data and gives all training information and final accuracy then saves the trained network into a .mat file. The second code Use_CNN takes in a new blood cells photo and uses the trained net to classify this new example then gives the final output with probability of the correctness of classification.
